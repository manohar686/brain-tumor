# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection Using Machine Learning

This project implements a machine learning–based approach to detect brain tumors from MRI images. The system analyzes medical images and classifies them as **Tumor** or **No Tumor**, supporting early-stage analysis.

## 📌 Objective
To build and evaluate a model that can automatically identify brain tumors from MRI scans.

## 🧪 Methodology
- Load MRI image dataset  
- Preprocess images (resize, normalization)  
- Train machine learning / deep learning model  
- Evaluate model performance  
- Predict tumor presence  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
Python, Jupyter Notebook, NumPy, Pandas, OpenCV, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras

## ▶️ How to Run
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib opencv-python scikit-learn tensorflow
jupyter notebook brain-tumor.ipynb

## 📊 Output

MRI images are classified into:

* **Tumor**
* **No Tumor**
